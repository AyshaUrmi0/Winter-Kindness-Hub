# Winter Kindness Hub

A winter donation web application that connects donors with volunteers to provide winter clothing to those in need across Bangladesh. This platform ensures that your act of kindness brings warmth to thousands of vulnerable people struggling to stay warm during the cold months.

## Purpose

When the weather gets colder, many people, especially in rural and low-income areas, face extreme challenges due to the lack of warm clothing. The **Winter Kindness Hub** aims to bridge this gap by providing an easy-to-use platform where donors can contribute winter clothes to those who need them most. With this application, users can join donation campaigns, browse details, and donate via a simple form after logging in. Together, we can make a difference and spread warmth this winter.
